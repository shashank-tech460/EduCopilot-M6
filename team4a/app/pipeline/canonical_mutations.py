"""Phase 1 -- the two Qdrant delete operations Rev.4.4 permits, and only those two.

Deliberately separate from `app/pipeline/publisher.py`: `Publisher` itself is
frozen, existing, tested code whose own contract (`upsert`-only, via
`QdrantClientProtocol`) is untouched by Phase 1. Delete is a new capability
this phase introduces, used exclusively by the canonical-ingestion
orchestrator (`canonical_ingestion.py`), never by the legacy Celery tasks.

Exactly two delete shapes exist, matching Rev.4.4 precisely -- no others:

  1. `delete_exact_points` -- delete a specific, known set of point IDs.
     Always safe by construction: a worker can only ever pass IDs it
     itself computed from its own chunk_ids, so this can never touch
     another attempt's data regardless of any filter logic.
     (Rev.4.4 §8.2.2.2 -- the completion-time-claim-failure self-heal.)

  2. `delete_older_generations` -- delete every point for one `document_id`
     whose `ingestion_generation` is strictly LESS THAN the caller's own,
     now-authoritative generation. This is the corrected, monotonic filter
     (`<`, never `!=`) -- a chunk at the caller's own generation or any
     higher generation can never match this filter, regardless of when it
     executes, because that is a static, arithmetic property of the filter
     expression itself, not a claim that depends on execution ordering.
     (Rev.4.4 §8.2.2.3 -- the confirmed winner's housekeeping cleanup.)
