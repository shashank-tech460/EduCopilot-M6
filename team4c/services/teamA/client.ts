/**
 * Real Team A client -- Phase 2D: authenticated canonical wiring.
 *
 * Replaces the earlier stale, static-API-key placeholder. Every call
 * mints a fresh, short-lived (Phase 2B default: 300s) ES256 internal
 * service JWT from SERVER-VERIFIED identity (`context`, supplied by the
 * caller -- see app/api/workspaces/[id]/files/route.ts's
 * `handOffToTeamA`, which only calls this after `assertOwnership()` has
 * already confirmed the authenticated user belongs to the target
 * workspace) -- never a client-supplied or request-body value. The JWT
 * is sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; the wire body sent to
 * `/v1/ingest` is EXACTLY `TeamASubmitRequest` (`{document_id, file_type,
 * file_url}`) via `JSON.stringify(request)` -- no identity field is ever
 * added to it, by construction (the type itself has none, and this
 * function never spreads `context` into the body).
 *
 * `TEAM_A_API_URL` is the INTERNAL service URL (browsers never see or
 * call this) -- there is no API-key configuration anymore; the JWT IS
 * the authentication. The private signing key
 * (`SERVICE_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`) is read only by `lib/serviceJwt.ts`, only
 * in this server-side module, and is never sent anywhere, logged, or
 * reachable from any client/browser code path.
