"""Team 4B ConversationManager (Task 4.1).

Implements the Redis-backed conversation-history primitives needed by
Requirement 4 (Conversational Query API) and Requirement 5 (Multi-Turn
Conversation): appending user/assistant turns, reading full history, and
reading a bounded conversation window -- feeding, but not implementing,
Properties 13-14 (Task 4.2) and the eventual `/api/v1/query` /
`/api/v1/sessions/{id}/history` routes (Task 8.1).

APPROVED CONTRACT (from the official specification, verbatim structure):

    Redis key:   session:{session_id}
    Stored value: a Redis list of JSON turns, each shaped:
        {"role": "user" | "assistant", "content": str, "timestamp": float}

SCOPE NOTE (Task 4.1 only): this module does NOT implement:
  - Task 4.2's property tests (P13: history append round-trip, P14:
    conversation window bound).
  - Reference resolution, summarization, or any other Requirement 5
    orchestration logic (that belongs to a later RAGService/prompt-
    construction task).
  - Session auto-creation as a distinct HTTP-facing concept, or any API
    route (`/api/v1/query`, `/api/v1/sessions/{id}/history` are Task
    8.1). What this module DOES provide is the primitive Task 8.1 will
    need: `append_turn` creates a session implicitly (a Redis list key
    springs into existence on its first RPUSH -- there is no separate
    Redis "create an empty list" operation), so "auto-create when
    absent" is naturally satisfied by simply calling `append_turn`;
    nothing here invents a distinct session-creation API surface beyond
    that.

MINIMAL MODEL NOTE (consistent with the precedent already set in Task
2.1's `ContextChunk` and Task 1.2's still-outstanding status -- see this
task's report for the flagged discrepancy about Task 1.2's actual
completion state): `ConversationTurn` is a small dataclass here, not a
Task-1.2 Pydantic model, because Task 1.2 has not actually been
implemented in this workspace despite being listed as already-approved
in this task's brief. Its shape is exactly what the official
specification states verbatim (role/content/timestamp), so this is not
an invented contract.

DOCUMENTED INTERPRETATION -- "TTL resets on interaction": the official
wording doesn't specify whether a mere *read* (`get_history`) counts as
an "interaction" that renews the TTL, or only a *write* (a new turn
being appended). This implementation renews the TTL only on
`append_turn` -- reading history never touches the TTL. Rationale: a
"turn" is the natural unit of "an interaction" in a conversational
system, and letting reads alone keep a session alive indefinitely (e.g.
an admin or debugging tool repeatedly calling `get_history`) would give
TTL a different, wider meaning than "conversation session inactivity"
implies. This is a judgment call on ambiguous wording, not something the
specification states outright -- flagged in the Task 4.1 report rather
than presented as unambiguous.

DOCUMENTED INTERPRETATION -- Redis failure handling: neither the
Conversational-Query nor Multi-Turn-Conversation requirement defines a
concrete "graceful Redis degradation" mechanism at the ConversationManager
level (a Phase-1 analysis ambiguity, carried forward unresolved). Rather
than inventing a fallback (e.g. silently proceeding with no history),
every Redis operation failure here raises a typed
`ConversationStoreUnavailableError` -- consistent with this project's
existing `VectorStoreUnavailableError` pattern (Task 2.1). No retry/
backoff is implemented (unlike `VectorStoreManager`'s Requirement-1.5-
mandated retries): neither Requirement 4 nor 5 specifies retry behavior
for Redis, so none is added. Whether/how a caller degrades gracefully
(e.g. a future RAGService orchestrator proceeding without history) is
explicitly left to that later task, not decided here.
