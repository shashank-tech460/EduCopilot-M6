"""Team 4B query/response Pydantic models and enums (Corrective Task 1.2).

Implements the API-contract-level data models the official Team 4B
specification defines for the retrieval/query surface: `SearchMode`,
`RetrievalConfig`, `QueryRequest`, `SourceAttribution`, and
`QueryResponse`.

SCOPE NOTE: this module is data/validation only. Nothing here queries
Qdrant, Redis, or Ollama; performs BM25/embedding/RRF; generates
answers; or mutates a session. No `/api/v1/query` (or any other) API
route is implemented -- that remains Task 8.1. No RAGService
orchestration is implemented -- that remains Task 7.1.

RELATIONSHIP TO `app/models/retrieval.py`'s `RetrievalResult`:
`RetrievalResult` is a distinct, already-approved (Task 2.1) internal
component-contract type used by `VectorStoreManager`/`HybridRetriever`'s
own return values. It is NOT replaced, redesigned, or merged with
anything here, per this corrective task's explicit instruction to
preserve existing approved behavior. `SourceAttribution` (this module)
is a separate, API-facing model that a later task (7.1/8.1) will build
FROM `RetrievalResult` data -- that assembly logic does not exist yet
and is explicitly out of this task's scope.

RELATIONSHIP TO `app/services/hybrid_retriever.py`'s `SearchMode`:
`HybridRetriever.retrieve()` already has its own
`SearchMode = Literal["hybrid", "semantic", "keyword"]` type alias and
its own `InvalidSearchModeError` runtime validation, predating this
module. Per this corrective task's explicit instruction not to modify
service implementations unless the official Task 1.2 contract requires
it, `hybrid_retriever.py` is NOT changed to import or depend on this
module's `SearchMode` enum -- the two independently express the same
three values (`hybrid`, `semantic`, `keyword`) in different but
compatible forms (a `Literal` vs. an `Enum`). This is a deliberate,
flagged duplication, not an oversight: unifying them would be a
service-implementation change this task's brief does not authorize.

DEFAULTS DESIGN DECISION -- `RetrievalConfig`'s field defaults
(`top_k=5`, `score_threshold=0.3`, `search_mode=hybrid`) are literal
values, not a `default_factory` reading `Settings` at instantiation
time. Two designs were considered:
  (a) hardcoded literals matching the official defaults exactly
      (chosen), with a test asserting they never drift from
      `Settings.default_top_k` / `default_score_threshold` /
      `default_search_mode`;
  (b) `Field(default_factory=lambda: get_settings().default_top_k)`,
      so a `RetrievalConfig` instantiated after an environment-variable
      override would automatically reflect it.
Neither official document requires live, env-var-reactive Pydantic
model defaults, and (a) is simpler and avoids a Pydantic model reaching
into global cached settings state at instantiation time purely for its
own field defaults. This is a documented internal implementation
choice, not a public-contract-affecting one: the JSON schema and
observable default VALUES are identical to what (b) would produce under
the actual approved `Settings` defaults.
