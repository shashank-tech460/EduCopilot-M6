"""Team 4B FastAPI application entry point (Tasks 8.1, 9.1).

Minimal application factory + module-level `app` instance for
`uvicorn app.api.main:app`. Registers Task 8.1's two routes
(`POST /api/v1/query`, `GET /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/history`) and
Task 9.1's evaluation route (`POST /api/v1/evaluate`) -- no `/health` or
`/metrics` (Task 10.1), and no Docker/deployment configuration (Task
11.1). Those are explicitly out of scope and are not added here as
placeholders.

PHASE 5C-2 ADDITION -- BM25 startup lifecycle: `HybridRetriever.
refresh_bm25_corpus()` has existed since Task 3.2 but was never called
by anything in the live application (see
`team4b/data/m6_phase5b_retrieval_reliability_diagnosis.md` -- confirmed
by static analysis of every route/dependency in this app AND by log
evidence: the BM25 corpus was permanently empty in every deployed
Team4A/4B process this whole engagement). `lifespan` below calls it
exactly once, synchronously, before the app starts accepting requests,
against the SAME cached `HybridRetriever` instance every query request
already uses (`app.api.dependencies.get_hybrid_retriever()`) -- no new
BM25 implementation, no duplicated wiring, no change to tokenization,
ranking, or RRF math. Deliberately non-fatal on failure: BM25 is a
ranking-quality enhancement to hybrid search, not an availability
dependency (the same principle already established for the optional
reranker -- see `HybridRetriever._finalize_results()`'s own docstring).
A refresh failure is logged clearly and the application still starts;
hybrid mode simply continues running as it always has (semantic-leg-only
ranking within RRF fusion) until a later successful refresh, rather than
never even attempting one.
